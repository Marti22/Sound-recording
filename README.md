# Sound-recording
To record sound I used the NAudio library. On the form there are two buttons - one for the start of the recording (Start recording), the other for the ending (Stop recording). After downloading the library, add a reference to the project to the project so that the namespaces in NAudio are visible. Link to download NAudio library: https://naudio.codeplex.com/
